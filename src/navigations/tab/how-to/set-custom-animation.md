# Set custom animation

Tab supports custom animations for both previous and next actions from the provided animation option of `Animation` library.
The [`animation`](../../api/tab#animation) property also allows you to set [`easing`](../../api/tab/tabActionSettings#easing),
[`duration`](../../api/tab/tabActionSettings#duration), and various other [`effect`](../../api/tab/tabActionSettings#effect).

Default animation is given as `SlideLeftIn` for [`previous`](../../api/tab/tabAnimationSettingsModel#previous)
tab animation and `SlideRightIn` for [`next`](../../api/tab/tabAnimationSettingsModel#next) tab animation.
You can also disable the animation by setting the animation effect as none.

The sample demonstrates some types of animation that suits Tab. You can check all the animation effects here.

# Localization

Localization library allows to localize the default text content of the Tab to different cultures using the [`locale`](../api/tab#locale)
property. In Tab, the close button's tooltip text alone will be localize based on culture.  The
close button is shown on tab header when enabled [`showCloseButton`](../api/tab#showclosebutton) property.

| Locale key | en-US (default)  |
|------|------|-------------|
| closeButtonTitle |  Close |

## Loading translations

To load translation object in an application use `load` function of `L10n` class.

In the below sample, `French` culture is set to Tab and change the close button's tooltip
text.

{% tab template="tab/basic", sourceFiles="app/**/*.ts,index.html,index.css"  %}

```typescript
import { Component, ViewChild, OnInit, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';
import { TabComponent } from '@syncfusion/ej2-angular-navigations';
import { L10n } from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';
import { EmitType } from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-container',
    template: `
     <ejs-tab id="element" locale="fr-BE" showCloseButton=true>
            <e-tabitems>
                <e-tabitem [header]='headerText[0]' [content]="content0"></e-tabitem>
                <e-tabitem [header]='headerText[1]' [content]="content1"></e-tabitem>
                <e-tabitem [header]='headerText[2]' [content]="content2"></e-tabitem>
            </e-tabitems>
        </ejs-tab>

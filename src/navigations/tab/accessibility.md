# Accessibility

## ARIA attributes

Tab component is designed by considering [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#Tabpanel)
standard.
Tab is supported with ARIA Accessibility which is accessible by on-screen readers, and other assistive
technology devices.
The following list of attributes are added in the Tab.

| **Roles and Attributes** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| `tablist` | This is set to role attribute in the Tab element that describes actual role of the element.|
| `tabpanel` | This is set to role attribute for the Tab content that describes the role for viewing the active content.|
| presentation       | This is set to role attribute for nested elements in the Tab.  |
| aria-orientation    | It indicates the Tab header orientation. Default value of this attribute is `horizontal`. |
| aria-activedescendant    | It indicates the current active child of the Tab component. |
| aria-haspopup       | It indicates the popup mode in the Tab. The default value of this attribute is false. If popup mode is enabled, the attribute value is set to true. |
| aria-disabled       | It indicates the disabled state of the Tab. |
| aria-selected       | It indicates the selection state for Tab items. Active Tab is set to true for this attribute. |
| aria-hidden      | It indicates the hidden element of the Tab. |
| aria-controls       | It indicates the associated `Tabpanel` for the header. |
| aria-labelledby       | It indicates the associated Tab header for the content. |

## Keyboard interaction

By default, keyboard navigation is enabled. This component implements keyboard navigation support by
following the WAI-ARIA practices. Once focused on the active Tab element,
you can use the following key combination for interacting with the Tab.

| Key           | Description                                                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>Left</kbd>    | Moves focus to the previous Tab. If focus is on the first Tab, the focus will not move to any Tab. |
| <kbd>Right</kbd>   | Moves focus to the next Tab. If focus is on the last Tab element, the focus will not move to any Tab. |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd> Space</kbd>  | Selects the Tab if it is not selected. Opens the popup dropdown icon if it is focussed. Select the Tab item as active when popup item is focussed. |
| <kbd>Esc(Escape)</kbd>           | Closes the popup if popup is in opened state.       |
| <kbd>Down</kbd> or <kbd>Up</kbd>   | When the popup is open and focused, it will move to previous/next Tab items of the popup in the vertical direction. |
|  <kbd>Home</kbd>    | Moves focus to the first Tab. |
|  <kbd>End </kbd>   | Moves focus to the last Tab. |
|  <kbd>Shift + F10 </kbd>   | If popup mode is enabled, it opens the popup when the Tab is focused. |
|  <kbd>Delete</kbd>    | Deletes the Tab, if close button is enabled in Tab header. |

                                HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along
                                with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually engaging web
                                pages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. Web browsers can read
                                HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically
                                along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

                                C# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its development team is led
                                by Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version is C# 5.0, which was released on August 15, 2012.

                                Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by Sun Microsystems, later acquired by Oracle Corporation,
                                that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment.
                                Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers
                                and supercomputers. While less common, Java applets run in secure, sandboxed environments to provide many features
                                of native applications and can be embedded in HTML pages.

                                Xamarin is a San Francisco, California based software company created in May 2011[3] by the engineers that created Mono,[4]
                                Mono for Android and MonoTouch that are cross-platform implementations of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)
                                and Common Language Specifications (often called Microsoft .NET). With a C#-shared codebase, developers can use Xamarin
                                tools to write native Android, iOS, and Windows apps with native user interfaces and share code across multiple platforms.[5]
                                Xamarin has over 1 million developers in more than 120 countries around the World as of May 2015.

                                ASP.NET is an open-source server-side web application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages.
                                It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services.
                                It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the successor to Microsoft\'\s
                                Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), allowing programmers
                                to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language. The ASP.NET SOAP extension framework allows ASP.NET components
                                to process SOAP messages.

                                The ASP.NET MVC is a web application framework developed by Microsoft, which implements the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern.
                                It is open-source software, apart from the ASP.NET Web Forms component which is proprietary. In the later versions
                                of ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Web Pages (a platform using only Razor pages) will merge into
                                a unified MVC 6.The project is called ASP.NET vNext.

                                JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language. It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so
                                that client-side scripts could interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter
                                the document content that was displayed.[5] More recently, however, it has become common in both game development
                                and the creation of desktop applications.

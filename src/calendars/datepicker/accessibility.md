and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

DatePicker provides built-in compliance with the
[WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices) specifications. WAI-ARIA
supports is achieved through the attributes
like `aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-activedescendant`

# Angular Universal

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
Angular is a client-side web development framework. On the contrary, conventional web technologies such as Asp.Net WebForms and Asp.Net MVC, etc.. are server-side frameworks. So, most of the web tools are designed by keeping these conventional web technologies in mind.

This pushes the Angular to support server-side rendering, which is called the 'Angular Universal', in line with other conventional technologies.

# Open and Save

In import an excel file, it needs to be read and converted to client side Spreadsheet model. The converted client side Spreadsheet model is sent as JSON which is used to render Spreadsheet. Similarly, when you save the Spreadsheet, the client Spreadsheet model is sent to the server as JSON for processing and saved. Server configuration is used for this process.

## Open

The Spreadsheet control opens an Excel document with its data, style, format, and more. To enable this feature, set [`allowOpen`](../api/spreadsheet/#allowopen) as `true` and assign service url to the [`openUrl`](../api/spreadsheet/#openurl) property.

### User Interface

In user interface you can open an Excel document by clicking `File > Open` menu item in ribbon.

The following code example shows `Open` option in the Spreadsheet control.

{% tab template="spreadsheet/open-save", sourceFiles="app/**/*.ts", isDefaultActive=true , iframeHeight="450px" %}

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-container',
    template: "<ejs-spreadsheet openUrl='https://ej2services.syncfusion.com/production/web-services/api/spreadsheet/open' allowOpen='true'> </ejs-spreadsheet>"
})
export class AppComponent { }
```

{% endtab %}

> * Use `Ctrl + O` keyboard shortcut to open Excel documents.
> * The default value of the [allowOpen](../api/spreadsheet/#allowopen) property is `true`. For demonstration purpose, we have showcased the [allowOpen](../api/spreadsheet/#allowopen) property in previous code snippet.

## Save

The Spreadsheet control saves its data, style, format, and more as Excel file document. To enable this feature, set [`allowSave`](../api/spreadsheet/#allowsave) as `true` and assign service url to the [`saveUrl`](../api/spreadsheet/#saveurl) property.

### User Interface

In user interface, you can save Spreadsheet data as Excel document by clicking `File > Save As` menu item in ribbon.

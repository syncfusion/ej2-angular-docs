## Setting default properties during control initialization

The properties of the stamp annotation can be set before creating the control using the StampSettings.

After editing the default opacity using the Edit Opacity tool, they will be changed to the selected values.
Refer to the following code sample to set the default sticky note annotation settings.

```typescript
import { ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import {
  PdfViewerComponent, LinkAnnotationService, BookmarkViewService, MagnificationService, ThumbnailViewService,
  ToolbarService, NavigationService, TextSearchService, TextSelectionService, PrintService, AnnotationService
} from '@syncfusion/ej2-angular-pdfviewer';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  // Specifies the template string for the PDF Viewer component.
  template: `<div class="content-wrapper">
  <ejs-pdfviewer id="pdfViewer" [serviceUrl]='service' [documentPath]='document' [stampSettings]='stampSettings' style="height:640px;display:block"></ejs-pdfviewer>
  </div>`,
  providers: [LinkAnnotationService, BookmarkViewService, MagnificationService, ThumbnailViewService, ToolbarService,
NavigationService, TextSearchService, TextSelectionService, PrintService, AnnotationService]
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild('pdfviewer')
  public pdfviewerControl: PdfViewerComponent;
  public service: string = 'https://ej2services.syncfusion.com/production/web-services/api/pdfviewer';

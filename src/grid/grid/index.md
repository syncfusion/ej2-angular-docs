# Overview

The Grid component is used to display and manipulate tabular data with configuration options to control the way the data is presented and manipulated.
It will pull data from a data source, such as an array of JavaScript objects, **OData web services**, or **DataManager** and
binding data fields to columns. Also displaying a column header to identify the field with support for grouped records.
